        <h3>Along Came a Spider</h3>
        <p>
          A bite from a spider somehow granted teenager Peter Parker its
          arachnid abilities and instead of using them for personal gain, he
          decided to help others with them. An orphan living with his aunt, May
          Parker, the boy chose to wear a mask while fighting crime so as not to
          burden her with his actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Calling himself Spider-Man and sporting a pair of web-shooting devices
          he’d constructed, Parker wound up in internet videos which attracted
          the attention of Tony Stark. The billionaire industrialist deduced
          Spider-Man’s secret identity and approached Parker at his and May’s
          home in Queens, New York with a request for aid from the hero in an
          upcoming confrontation with Captain America and a group of other rogue
          Avengers and associates. Parker was initially hesitant to even admit
          his secret career as Spider-Man, but the thrill of adventure and
          Stark’s talk of responsibility drew him in and he accepted the
          invitation, as well as a new, high-tech costume and web-shooters.

        <h3>Does Whatever a Spider Can</h3>
        <p>
          Peter Parker’s gifts from the spider bite include enhanced strength,
          stamina, and agility, as well as the ability to cling to nearly any
          surface by his hands and feet, and an internal “alarm” of sorts that
          warns him of impending danger. When in costume he becomes a figure in
          motion, leaping and jumping about with a steady stream of wisecracks.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Spider-Man suit designed by Tony Stark includes wrist-worn
          web-shooters (adapted from Peter’s own invention) that emit lines of
          synthetic “webbing” capable of supporting great weight with a
          high-degree of holding power. In addition, the suit provides various
          optical powers, a voice-changer, a drone tracking device, and some
          protection against outside elements. When not in use, the suit appears
          as loose, thin cloth, but when donned, it adheres tightly to the body
          and stretches easily to almost any movement by the wearer.
